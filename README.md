# Waduzitdo
A Tiny Language based on PILOT in 256 bytes of Z80 or 8080 Code

Waduzitdo featured in Byte September 1978. It is a tiny framework that allows text to be stored into memory, edited and recalled using simple character commands. Listings for 6800, 8080 and Pascal were provided.

It would be hard-pushed to say that it is a language, but more of a user friendly, interactive text storage/retrieval means for early microprocessors. If you had an early 6800 or Z80 system with a serial terminal and simple hex monitor program, Waduzitdo would bring a whole new set of text-based possibilities to such a system.


As a "language" it probably has only a few niche applications - such as text-based adventure games or question and answer (quiz) games.


What is more interesting is that it provides a framework for entering text into memory a line at a time and the ability to edit the text, with what is probably the world's smallest text editor.



The other feature that might be useful is the S:x command that puts x into the accumulator where it can be used to call a subroutine. This would allow menus of commands to be executed, just by entering a single character. This would allow the language to be extended to suit the users application.
Using a computer to selectively drill down into a text database, presenting specific text output, based on simple text character inputs and Yes/No logic is a powerful technique.
